# An AI-Driven Framework for Supportive Multi-sensory Art Education to Advance Equity for ADHD Learners

This repository contains information related to the paper titled "An AI-Driven Framework for Supportive Multi-sensory Art Education to Advance Equity for ADHD Learners."

## üìù About the Project

[cite_start]Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often face significant challenges in traditional art education, which typically relies on sustained visual attention and static instructional methods[cite: 16, 17, 60]. [cite_start]This project introduces **CAMS (a Cognitively Accessible Multi-sensory System)**, an innovative AI-driven framework designed to address these challenges and promote educational equity[cite: 4].

[cite_start]CAMS leverages a sophisticated pipeline of generative AI and multi-modal analysis to transform static visual artworks into personalized, attention-supportive, multi-sensory learning experiences[cite: 4, 24, 25]. [cite_start]By generating complementary auditory content (music and soundscapes) specifically engineered for the cognitive patterns of ADHD learners, the system creates multiple pathways for engagement and fosters a more inclusive educational environment[cite: 25, 26].
